These are some tools I am working on for using Z notation in my work.

For the moment, my plan is to have a tool that will convert "email-style" Z notation into Unicode Z notation. I'd like to be able to insinuate the ASCII art into any text file and have a tool that outputs the same file with the Z notation converted to Unicode, such as a Markdown file.

It may be nice as well to convert to `\usepackage{fuzz}`-style LaTeX notation.

I have no current plans to go beyond this scope, although it might be an interesting project to work on the semantics of Z.
